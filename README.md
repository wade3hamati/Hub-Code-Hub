# LeetCode Solutions Repository

This repository is dedicated to storing my solutions for LeetCode problems. I have used the LeetHub Chrome extension to automatically push my solutions to this repository.

## Installation

To use this repository and push your LeetCode solutions using LeetHub, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

2. Install the LeetHub Chrome extension from the Chrome Web Store. You can find it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leethub/aciombdipochlnkbpcbgdpjffcfdbggi).

3. After installing the extension, click on the LeetHub icon in your Chrome toolbar.

4. In the LeetHub popup, click on the "Connect GitHub" button and authorize LeetHub to access your GitHub account.

5. Once connected, you will see a list of your repositories. Select the repository from the list.

6. LeetHub will automatically detect your LeetCode submissions and start pushing them to the repository.

## Usage

Whenever you solve a LeetCode problem on the LeetCode website, LeetHub will automatically detect your solution and push it to the repository. The LeetCode problem name will be used as the filename, and the code you submitted will be saved in that file.

To view or modify your solutions, simply navigate to the repository's page on GitHub. Each solution is stored in a separate file, making it easy to browse and search for specific problems.
